# Hi, I'm Ceferino Patino

**Researcher | Software Developer | Open Source Contributor**  
Computer Science at University of Nebraska – Lincoln (2024–2026)  
Passionate about multi-agent systems, scientific computing, and developer tooling.

## About Me

I am an aspiring computer scientist focused on building robust, scalable software systems that bridge research and real-world impact. Currently, I develop tools for multi-agent reinforcement learning, high-throughput microscopy, and open scientific infrastructure.

- Currently learning Rust, CUDA, and MARL frameworks  
- Contributing to open research in AI via OASYS Lab  
- Open source contributor to the NixOS ecosystem  
- Co-led the MOASEI Competition at AAMAS 2025
